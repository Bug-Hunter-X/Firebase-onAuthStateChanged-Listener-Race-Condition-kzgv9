# Firebase onAuthStateChanged Listener Race Condition

This repository demonstrates a common race condition issue when using Firebase's `onAuthStateChanged` listener. The problem arises when asynchronous operations are performed within the listener before user data is fully loaded after authentication.

## The Problem
The `onAuthStateChanged` listener provides the current authentication state.  However, if you attempt to immediately access user data (e.g., `user.uid`, `user.displayName`) inside the listener before Firebase completes loading user information, you might encounter null or undefined values leading to errors or unexpected app behavior.

## Reproducing the Bug
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the necessary packages: `npm install`.
3. Run the application: `npm start`.
4. Observe the console logs and the potential errors in the application's behavior.

## Solution
The solution is to ensure that all operations relying on user data are performed *only after* Firebase has fully populated the user object within the `onAuthStateChanged` listener.  This typically involves using asynchronous JavaScript patterns (e.g., promises, async/await) or callback functions to guarantee proper sequencing.
